# Voyage Island

Sometimes your life path could make you a gift and put you on a legacy project written on [Magnolia CMS](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/), and probably the worst thing you'll face is that you cannot rewrite that project using a silver bullet (e.g., [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/))... but still your destiny force you to make this project great again and here we come to the [Island Architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/islands-architecture/) which uses old-fashioned approaches with some pinch of "modern glow": splitting a bundle into smaller chunks, isolating components from each other, downloading only what you are using on a page, and unblocking the main thread.

So, the primary purpose of the Voyage Island library is to give you tools to implement Island Architecture over static HTML on the client side.
